WWW::Google::Login - log a mechanize object into Google

DESCRIPTION

This module automates logging in a (Javascript capable) WWW::Mechanize
object into Google. This is useful for scraping information from Google
applications.

Currently, this module only works in conjunction with L<WWW::Mechanize::Chrome>,
but ideally it will evolve to not requiring Javascript or Chrome at all.
